Private Motor (including Prestige),Separate Basis of Settlement Clause,Choice of Repairer,9138,"In an endeavour to keep the costs of repairs down (and to make the repair of a damaged vehicle as timely as possible for their customers), many Insurers have compiled a network of selected repairers to which their customers are directed following an accident. The Insured is often given the choice to decide which of the Insurer’s chosen repairers they want to do the work on their vehicle. In the majority of cases this is a satisfactory arrangement for the customer particularly if they haven’t had any experience with smash repairers in the past.

In a number of cases though, the Insured may be unhappy with this arrangement, particularly if they have a repairer who has done work for them in the past and they wish to use the same repairer again. Most Insurers will allow their customers to submit a quote from a repairer outside of the Insurer’s chosen network and if the quote is acceptable to the Insurer then authorisation is usually given.In some instances, particularly with specialist vehicle Insurers, the Insurer will offer the Insured their choice of repairer. In all cases, however, the Insured needs to be aware that the Insurer will may retain the right to pay only the most competitive quote. They may also retain the right to select the method of repair e.g. whether to panel beat a damaged door panel or whether to replace it with a new panel.

For those Insurers who do not have their own network of repairers it is usual practice to request that the Insured obtain quotes from two repairers and the Insurer will advise which quote is acceptable to them. If the Insurer authorises the repairs they will normally deal directly with the repairer, with the Insured usually only having to pay the excess either to the Insurer or directly to the repairerIn the event that the Insurer and the Insured cannot agree on who is to do the repairs, the Insured can always choose to authorise and pay their own repairer, but the Insurer is not obligated to pay any more than the quote they had selected and they will not usually guarantee any of the repairs.",Car Insurance Policy (PDS),BestBuy-Car_0321-SPDS_0922,BestBuy Insurance,,,,
